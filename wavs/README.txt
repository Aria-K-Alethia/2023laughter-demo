# Introduction
Supplementary materials of the paper "Laughter Synthesis using Pseudo Phonetic Tokens with a Large-scale In-the-wild Laughter Corpus" submitted to Interspeech 2023.

# Content
We share a part of the utterances used in the evaluations.
Each directory represents a method (baseline, l5, l8, l12, hifigan) or ground truth utterances (gt).
Each directory contains two folders: 
	- test: utterances of the test set
	- tlm (if applicable): utterances synthesized from the sequences of PPTs generated by token language model unconditionally
	
The filenames are formated as {speaker}-{id}.wav.
	
Note that, the utterances under gt/tlm are the same with utterances under gt/test. They are only used in the SMOS test in the evaluation of tLM.

The full corpus and code will be open-sourced after acceptance.
